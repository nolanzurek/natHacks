StanlEEG is an interactive 3D video game that responds directly to the players mood and fatigue levels. By processing data retrieved from an EEG to interpret emotion (positive, negative, neutral) and fatigue (0 to 10) using python ML in order to alter the terrain to correlate with the player's mental state. The game itself was created in Unity, with imported custom made 3D models. This game is a new interactive and functional way to visualize a person's mood. Our goal is to better help people understand their own state of mind and encourage introspection in a friendly, easily accessible way. StanlEEG puts a an entertaining spin on taking care of yourself.

In order to play, download the StanleySim folder and run it in Unity 2022.1.11f1.
